node script to scrape data from the volleyball sa fixtures and convert to icalendar format

the source site is http://www.volleyballsa.com.au/stateleague/fixtures

Ensure node is installed on your command line and up to date and simply run _npm install_ followed by _node ./index.js_ from the root directory to run. The script will output each calendar in ics format in the calendars folder.

**Note:** this script pulls data live from the volleyballsa site so if the site layout is changed the script will no longer work!
